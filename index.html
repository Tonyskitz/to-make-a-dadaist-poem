Jon Jones needed just three minutes to defeat Ciryl Gane and cement himself as arguably the greatest UFC fighter of all time.

The 35-year-old returned to the octagon in emphatic fashion, defeating Gane via a clinical first round submission to stun the MMA world.Jones wasted no time taking Gane down to the canvas and up against the fence, where he quickly got his wrist under the Frenchman’s chin in a tight chokehold.

It was a nasty choke that forced Gane to tap out almost immediately, and that was all she wrote.

Jones, the former light heavyweight champion, is now the undisputed heavyweight champion and becomes just the eighth fighter to conquer two UFC divisions.

He also becomes the first fighter to win 15 UFC championship fights.It was unclear how Jones would fare in the cage, given he hadn’t fought since 2020 and packed on some serious weight to make the move up to heavyweight.

But after Francis Ngannou vacated the heavyweight title by leaving the UFC, Jones is suddenly a champion again.Jones improved his record to 21-1-0 and he has never lost a UFC fight.

The emphatic victory will only strengthen his claims to being the greatest fighter of all time, and it seems there’s plenty of life left in him.

Gane was left stunned by the ease of Jones victory, but there was nothing he could do.

UFC commentator Jon Anik said: “He still looks shook. He still looks in total disbelief.”

The victory was even more impressive given Jones had to remove tape from his foot as he was entering the octagon and copped a kick to the groin just seconds into the fight.

It was the only blow Gane managed to land.

Earlier, Hollywood actor Jake Gyllenhaal stole the show with a stunning knockout win in Las Vegas after turning heads with his chiselled physique at the weigh-in.`;
